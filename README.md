FINAL PROJECT

An resort company has everything it needs to ensure its guests have a pleasant visit to the tropical Dominican Republic. In other words, they needs a system that allows it to make reservations for its private restaurants. These restaurants are:

- Ember – Steakhouse
- Zao – Japanese Restaurant
- Grappa – Italian Restaurant
- Larimar – Seafood Restaurant

The system should include a menu so that the employee has the following options:
- Make a New Reservation: This will check if a new reservation can be added. All it asks for is the guest's name and the number of guests.
- View Reservations: To quickly view availability.

The following information will be saved per user:
- Guest name
- Selected time
- Selected restaurant
- Number of people (1-5)

The available hours for all restaurants are: 6 to 8 pm and 8 to 10 pm.

NOTE: Each restaurant has a total capacity of 12 people per time slot.

DELIVERY FORMAT: Compress into a .zip file (be careful to delete the Node_Modules folder).
